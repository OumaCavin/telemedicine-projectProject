## Project Structure

For a detailed and updated **Project Structure** of the telemedicine application, refer to the [Updated Project Structure](./backend/README.md) file.

### Frontend (React)

The frontend application is a React app that uses `react-router-dom` for routing and `axios` for making API requests.

#### Main Components

- **AuditLogList, CreateAuditLog, EditAuditLog, ViewAuditLog**: Manages audit logs.
- **PaymentList, CreatePayment, EditPayment, ViewPayment**: Manages payments.
- **StatusList, CreateStatus, EditStatus, ViewStatus**: Manages status records.
- **UserList, CreateUser, EditUser, ViewUser**: Manages user records.
- **AdminList, CreateAdmin, EditAdmin, ViewAdmin**: Manages admin records.
- **PatientList, CreatePatient, EditPatient, ViewPatient**: Manages patient records.
- **DoctorList, CreateDoctor, EditDoctor, ViewDoctor**: Manages doctor records.
- **AppointmentList, CreateAppointment, EditAppointment, ViewAppointment**: Manages appointments.
- **PrescriptionList, CreatePrescription, EditPrescription, ViewPrescription**: Manages prescriptions.
- **MessageList, CreateMessage, EditMessage, ViewMessage**: Manages messages.
- **HealthCenterList, CreateHealthCenter, EditHealthCenter, ViewHealthCenter**: Manages health centers.
- **HistoryList, CreateHistory, EditHistory, ViewHistory**: Manages medical histories.
- **RoleList, CreateRole, EditRole, ViewRole**: Manages roles.
- **RoleAssignmentList, CreateRoleAssignment, EditRoleAssignment, ViewRoleAssignment**: Manages role assignments.
- **RoleItemList, CreateRoleItem, EditRoleItem, ViewRoleItem**: Manages role items.
- **EhrRecordList, CreateEhrRecord, EditEhrRecord, ViewEhrRecord**: Manages Electronic Health Records.

### Backend (Node.js with Express)

The backend API handles CRUD operations for the various entities in the system, including user authentication and authorization. The API is built using Express.js and Sequelize ORM for interacting with the MySQL database.

#### Key Endpoints

- **/api/auth/login** - POST: User login (JWT-based authentication).
- **/api/users** - GET, POST: Get all users or create a new user.
- **/api/users/:id** - GET, PUT, DELETE: View, edit, or delete a specific user.
- **/api/appointments** - GET, POST: Get all appointments or create a new appointment.
- **/api/payments** - GET, POST: Get all payments or create a new payment.
- **/api/audit-logs** - GET: Get all audit logs.
- **/api/prescriptions** - GET, POST: Get all prescriptions or create a new prescription.
- **/api/roles** - GET, POST: Get all roles or create a new role.
- **/api/role-items** - GET, POST: Get all role items or create a new role item.

## Installation

### Backend

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OumaCavin/telemedicine-project.git
    cd telemedicine-app/backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory:
    ```
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=password
    DB_NAME=telemed_db
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

4. **Run the backend**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend will now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder**:
    ```bash
    cd telemedicine-app/frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the frontend development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Authentication

1. **Login**: Use the `/api/auth/login` endpoint to get a JWT token after providing valid user credentials. The JWT token is required for making authenticated requests to the API.

2. **Header setup**: All subsequent requests to the backend must include the JWT token in the Authorization header.
    ```bash
    Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
    ```
